1. Cloud
- prioritize speed, and have more apps hosted in the cloud

2. Observability
- unify all app and performace data on one screen, in real time. Prioritize context into interactions with the ability to customzie visualizations for deeper insights

3. Data driven 
- collect as much telemetry data as possible and connect it to business data
- allows data-driven business decisions

4. Resilience
- integrate chaos testing and automated remediation into development practices to build software that can withstand issues without complete failure

5. Devops
- build a culture of continuiuous integration and delivery, encourage developer autonomy and independence, rapid iteration, etc.

**Leaders vs Laggards**

_Why do Leaders Win?_
- learn about issues from tech vs from employees or customers
- resolve software issues faster and suffer fewer outages
- report higher revenue growth
- out-compete on pace of innovation, market leadership, employee engagement, and brand perception.

_What's Holding Laggards Back?_
- they lag in exploiting the cloud
- very few are developing for resilience -- poor customer experience
- while they may claim they practice observability, many learn of issues from customer complaints
- very few integrate systems data with customer experience data

**Leaders**

_Moving to Cloud Faster_
- software and systems in the cloud
- adopted a cloud native approach
- the move to the cloud is because they are concerned about security and risk management

_Mastered Observability_
- using a platform to identify things not defined
- making software observable is key to developing it
- learn of service interruptions via observability solutions
- they don't learn of service interruptions via customers

_Strategic with Data_
- integrating data on software and systems
- software and systems are instrumented
- can quickly understand result of software changes
- understand how customers use app and release features based off of it
- common language across an organization

_Develop with Resilience in Mind_
- top-performing firms "build for failure", which allows developers to make changes rapidly in response to changing customer needs
- have adopted chaos testing
- adopted automated remediation; best when problem is reoccuring
- have adopted continuous integration and delivery

_Commit to a DevOps Culture_
- culture and observability technology allow our developers to make quick devisions witout fear of repercussions
- MVV instead of MVP


Leaders make software a strategic priority. They spend less time fixing issues and experience fewer systems and software outages which gives them more time to innovate.

Adopting the five pillars is vital for these reasons:
- **Consumer preferences.** Loyalty is precarious. Great customer experience
- **Software complexity.** More technology, more points of failure
- **3rd-party collaboration.** Demand for cross-platform integration
- **observing first, less resolving**
